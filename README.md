# Introduction.
This is a project which i completed for my 4th year Applied Project and Minor Dissertation module in GMIT. It is an application which uses the MEAN(MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js) stack with ionic. In the app users will be able to post jobs the are looking to get somebody to do for them. The users will also be able to directly message each other through the App.

## Features of the App

1. **User Authentication Using Firebase**

When a user opens the app they will be immeditaly greeted with a login screen for the app. From here the user can log in Using the online Firebase database that has been set up for secure authentiction. The User can log in with an existing account created for the app and if they forgot their password with a reset password feature which will email them a password reset link.

2. **The Job Page**

On the job page the user can create jobs, which will be seen by all other users of the application. They must enter a title, description, location and their maximum price by tapping the + icon on the top right corner of the app. They can also swipe a job to the left to delete it or message the creator of the job.

3. **The Message Page**

In this page the users can interact with each other and send private messages back and forth. The username, time and the message will be displayed for each message sent. The sent message will be left-allined and the recieved messages will be right-allined.
